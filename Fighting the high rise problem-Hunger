Hunger is the most severe kind of poverty and hardship that exists. Up to 811 million people do not have enough to eat. Hungry individuals are unable to work to their full ability, they are more prone to illness. The agenda 2030 points the way to a fair world. In our study, we looked at agricultural growth in Telangana by, their district and their production rates for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. Here, the main challenge to this hackathon is to provide in which district the minimum and maximum crops are produced. So that we can eradicate the hunger crisis in that district or know the reasons behind the less crop production.
Materials and Method:
The problem statement we have selected is to find out the minimum and maximum production of crops in each district based on their total yields of the years 2016-2017,2017-2018,2018-2019. 
The objective of the problem is to find out in which districts the crop production is minimum so that we can concentrate on those districts to eradicate the hunger in future. 
Here we used Descriptive analysis to find approaches to our problems. The software we used here is Tableau to visualize and find solutions to the problem statement. 
The agricultural crops corn, groundnut, and Bengal gram are vital in the agricultural landscape for the state of Telangana. In this challenge we have shown the visualizations based on these three crops. The dataset is provided by the Telangana State hackathon challenge for the years 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 which consist of attributes: crop, district id, district, year, season, season yield, total yield. From this dataset we successfully found out which districts produces the maximum and minimum yields of crops. So that in the minimum districts we can concentrate more and find out the reasons for their less crop production and eradicate hunger. 
Results:
•	In figure 2.1 the dashboard explains about the 31 districts all crop production based on their seasonal yields and explains about the 31 districts individual crop production based on their seasonal yields.
•	In figure 2.2 the dashboard explains about the sum of district wise total and seasonal yields of crop, explains about the 16-17-18 seasonal yield of individual crops, explains about the 16-17-18 total yield of individual crops, explains about the 16-17-18 maximum total yield of individual crops, and finally explains about the 16-17-18 minimum total yield of individual crops. 
Based on sheet 7 we can say the minimum production of crop in the year 2016, 2017, 2018 and find solutions in how to increase their crops production in future and how to eradicate hunger in those districts. For more details, please check the tableau workbook named zero hunger.
Conclusion:
We are aiming for a society in which everyone has enough food to live a healthy and active lifestyle, where hunger is rare, and food comes from smart, effective, and reduced food systems that are consistent with natural resource sustainability. The main objective was to find out the minimum crop production in the districts for the respective years and find out the reasons why the crop production is less. Finding out these minimum crop yields can help us to eradicate the hunger those districts in the coming years. In Telangana the districts named Mahbubnagar, Ranga Reddy, Nagar Kurnool, Sanga Reddy, and Medak are the minimum productions of crops in the years 2018-2019, Similarly, if we do the analysis for every state by approximately 2030, India can become a hunger free country.
